# key-kiss

Welcome to 'key-kiss' (key keep it safe/secure)

A more secure way to store your private key, preventing your funds from being stolen if they find your 12 words.

There are two apps in this project:

1. A cli (secret-image-cli) that creates and image since a deterministic order for characters in matrix with a personal password.

2. A web app (slots-paper-create) that lets you choose the slots of your private key character in each col.
